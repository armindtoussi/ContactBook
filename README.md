Just a practice application that i've created to work and expand on core concepts. 

Concepts include: 
- recycler view 
- custom recycler adapter usage
- sqlite database contracts
- sqlite CRUD done with a Content Provider
- URI scheme for Content Provider 
- Builder Patterns
- and more...


This application is by no means perfect. There are bugs but i've accomplished what i wanted to accomplish therefore i'm not worrying about the little bugs here and there.
